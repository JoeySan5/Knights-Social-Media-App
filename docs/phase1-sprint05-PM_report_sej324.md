## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)? 
    * Yes
2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
    * Yes
3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.
    * Before we began, we organized our tasks on a Trello board and discussed each team member's roles. Even when working on individual parts, we made an effort to ask questions and help each other, which greatly contributed to meeting the sprint's requirements. We had two in-person meetings and one online meeting to complete various tasks, and everyone performed their respective tasks effectively. As the PM, I assigned tasks to individuals and coordinated schedules, ultimately completing the sprint while providing instructions for the video.
4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * We completed the design by creating diagrams and various information-containing documents. Each team member completed their unit tests and recorded videos, meeting all instructions. Team members provided feedback and assistance in finalizing the diagrams and mocks they created, which facilitated the sprint's completion.

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
    * There were no code reviews during this design sprint. However, we reviewed each other's README files and artifacts contained within. The project manager requested artifact reviews from each team member through Slack, and everyone readily provided their input. We all participated in video recording, with unit tests being recorded individually in a short and simple manner. Reviews were conducted initially as each task was completed, and a second review was done upon completing all tasks before recording the video. The Trello board was solely managed by the PM, and we used two boards to ensure everyone could easily keep track of it. We actively utilized team meetings, which took place both online and offline, and all team members actively reviewed each other's work.

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
    * To encourage the team to start working on phase activities sooner rather than later, I began by emphasizing the importance of creating the Trello board, starting with the most significant block. Team members were informed of this, and they each created labels and checklists for their respective blocks. I consistently provided updates on the schedule through Slack and sought cooperation from team members. Additionally, I prioritized tasks that needed immediate attention, such as creating Bitbucket admin accounts.

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?
    * I emphasized collaboration within the team and always welcomed input to ensure that my role as PM was performed effectively. I encouraged team members to ask questions and actively worked together to resolve issues under the guise of "feel free to ask." I promoted discussions and sought appropriate advice from mentors, effectively supporting each other.

8. How well is the team communicating? 
    * Our team engages in substantial communication, utilizing online meetings, offline meetings, and Slack for communication. As the PM, I tend to speak more, while team members often respond with brief answers or emojis to indicate their understanding. Our team members consistently notify each other when they have tasks or updates to share. If a team member did not participate in conversations for an extended period, it was because they had already shared their reasons in advance, so there was no cause for concern.
 
9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.
    * The team has actually increased communication as we've entered into more active collaboration. The use of Slack has become more frequent, and we've doubled the number of meetings. Team members have been highly cooperative and actively participating, and so far, there haven't been any major issues.

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.
    * However, this sprint presented significant challenges due to unclear instructions. Team members struggled to grasp exactly what needed to be done, and we faced difficulties at the beginning of the sprint. Our mentor actively provided solutions to help us overcome these issues, and we believe the sprint ended successfully. When there are problems that need quick solutions, we first check Piazza and then consult the mentor if we can't find a resolution.

## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    * 2023-10-05 4pm, around 20 minutes
    
1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
    * We actively used Trello boards, utilizing two boards, and provided clear guidance to team members on how to use them. The tasks were well-organized, contributing to the successful outcome of the sprint.

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
    * Team meetings were conducted twice offline and once online, with Slack being used for communication outside of meetings. In the first team meeting, we discussed scheduling, in the second, we focused on actual work (creating artifacts), and in the third, we recorded team videos.

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.
    * We consider Google Drive and Trello boards to be the key tools for this sprint. By neatly organizing many requirements and storing them in Drive, team members can easily access information. Unlike the previous week when everyone worked on individual tutorials, we now share the same board and Drive, promoting more effective communication.

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?
    * Currently, there haven't been significant difficulties among team members, but there is a potential challenge in the future due to individual circumstances, such as missing meetings or not being in contact for a day. However, in this sprint, we didn't face any issues as we shared our weekly plans during the first scheduling meeting.

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
    * The next sprint involves the PM's code review. I will be reviewing all the code, and the repository will be entirely managed by the PM. Team members should submit their pull requests promptly to reduce the PM's workload. We hope that all team members will complete their pull requests by Sunday.

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
    * So far, we don't believe there have been any significant difficulties or obstacles.

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
    * "Start": I propose that we ensure thorough management of the initial Trello board at the beginning of each sprint. Create detailed checklists and allocate tasks to each team member precisely. This will expedite the process.

    * "Stop": Team members should stop not checking Slack for more than a day. Especially, they should check whether they have been tagged in any threads or if there are urgent matters. This will enhance overall work efficiency.

    * "Continue": We will continue to encourage team members to ask questions and help each other actively. There should be no hesitation in seeking assistance, and we should be willing to help as much as possible when needed.

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?
    * In the early stages of this sprint, we had a short deadline, which made us initially think that there wouldn't be much work. However, we encountered more challenges than expected. We continuously checked instructions, asked questions, and made modifications with each answer received. The refinement phase after the initial completion took more time than anticipated.

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
    * Currently, our project is at a basic stage of posting and removing content at a simple level. We believe we need to address security issues and establish a clear concept for anonymous personas. We intend to differentiate users who use user IDs and simple visitors, and we also believe it's important to develop a more private social media platform. At the same time, we need to ensure that public spaces are well-developed for simple visitors.
